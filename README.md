### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm ClÃ©ment (a.k.a. kero).

I'm one of the co-founders of [Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch), as well as the CTO. 

Currently I live in Paris, but I was raised in Bordeaux, a city in France known for its wine production.

I've been interested in computer science since my childhood. At 15 or so I got interested in hacking, and more specifically RAT (Remote Access Tool) malwares. I had fun infecting computers and stealing the passwords of my friends, but _shhhh don't tell them_. Around 17 I built my first website named CartelAmple in Laravel and jquery, a website where users had their own public page exposing things they liked. 

I moved to Paris and started Ecole 42 after high school, in 2013. It was my first time doing backend programming, I mean working with C and really understanding what was happening in my terminal console. I really liked it.

My final internship was at Veepee, a major French e-commerce company, where I met Quentin & Thomas, and where we first started working on the project that would later become Meili. 

And that's it! that's what you should know about me if we're going to work together I think.

Oh, and also: I'm a huge Apple fanboy, and love video games.
