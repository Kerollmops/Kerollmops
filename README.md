### Hey, that's me kero üêµ

I come [from Bordeaux](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux) a french city, where I first started spending time on my computer.
I was interrested by trojan and other funny malwares.

At 18, just after my baccalaur√©at I started [42, a free school that were just been founded by Xavier Niel in 2013](https://www.42.fr/).

Since then I [had worked at Vente Priv√©e](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veepee) for 2 years then founded Meili in November 2018. We worked with Louis Vuitton who helped us grow and we are in production there since the beginning of the start-up. I am the co-founder of Meili along with [**@tpayet**](https://github.com/tpayet) and [**@qdequele**](https://github.com/qdequele).

### I am making [MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch) faster both in terms of indexing and searching ‚ö°Ô∏è

I recently achieved interresting results where I was able to index _~110 million_ songs in less than 30 minutes. The resulting database was only _28GB_ on disk. All of this was achieved on a 16GB/4CPUs machine (39$/month).

But the more important part is the query time, it is pretty good as it is able to [find relevant results in approximately _100ms_](https://twitter.com/Kerollmops/status/1282737080435605505?s=20) and all of this fits in ~1500 lines of Rust.
